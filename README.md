# Us-adult-census
The US Adult Census dataset is a repository of 48,842 entries extracted from the 1994 US
Census database.
In our first section, we explore the data at face value in order to understand the trends and
representations of certain demographics in the corpus. We then use this information in section
two to form models to predict whether an individual made more or less than $50,000 in 1994.
In the third section, we look into a couple papers written on the dataset to find out what
methods they are using to gain insight on the same data. Finally, in the fourth section, we
compare our models as well as that of others in order to find out what features are of
significance, what methods are most effective, and gain an understanding of some of the
intuition behind the numbers.
